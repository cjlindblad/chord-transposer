## Chord transposer

This is a library/application for transposing chord progressions. The idea is that certain keys are easier to play on certain instruments. On the piano, you'll tend to avoid the black keys, and on the guitar, many people struggle with bar chords.

The intended audience is people who are not musicians, that want to play songs with the least amount of hassle (think preschool teachers playing to the kids).

This is very much a work in progress. Latest version available here: https://chord-transposer.netlify.app/
